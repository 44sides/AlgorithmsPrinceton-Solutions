# Specification
Here is the programming assignment [specification](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php) that describes the assignment requirements.

Be sure that your code conforms to the prescribed APIs: each program must be in the "default" package (i.e., no package statements) and include only the public methods and constructors specified (extra private methods are fine). Note that algs4.jar uses a "named" package, so you must use an import statement to access a class in algs4.jar.
